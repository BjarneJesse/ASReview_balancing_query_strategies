# ASReview_balancing_query_strategies

##Overview

The purpose of this project is to explore how the choice of the balancing strategy and query strategy influences the performance of the active learning model ASReview. Specifically, we aim to adress the issue of 'trap formation' found by research of the RUG where researchers may only encounter onse side of the relevant papers. By optimizing these paramers, we seek seek to enhance the models abillity to provide comprehensive view of all the relevant literature. 

This repository contain the files to reproduce the simulation study and subsequent analysis of the data for this project (which was conducted for a Bachalor's thesis Sociology from Utrecht University).
