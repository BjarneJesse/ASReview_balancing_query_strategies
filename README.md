# ASReview_balancing_query_strategies

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to explore how the choice of the balancing strategy and query strategy influences the performance of the active learning model ASReview. Specifically, we aim to adress the issue of 'trap formation' found by research of the RUG where researchers may only encounter onse side of the relevant papers. By optimizing these paramers, we seek seek to enhance the models abillity to provide comprehensive view of all the relevant literature. 

This repository contain the files to reproduce the simulation study and subsequent analysis of the data for this project (which was conducted for a Bachalor's thesis Sociology from Utrecht University).

## Simulation1A

In the first simulation, all current query strategies are simulated to analyze their performance and effectiveness in the context of this dataset. This simulation gives a comparison and evaluation of each of the current strategy's impact on a 'normal' dataset. We will do this with all the different parameters on default. 

## Simulation1B

In this simulation, all current balancing strategies are simulated to analyze their performance and effectiveness in the context of this dataset. This simulation gives a comparison and evaluation of each of the current strategy's impact on a 'normal' dataset. We will do this with all the different parameters on default. 

## Simulation2A

In this simulation the interaction between the balancing strategy 'simple' and the different query-strategies are analyzed. This simulation gives a comparison and evaluation of each of the query-strategies with the balancing strategy set on 'simple', This means there is no balancing strategy. This comparison will be done on the same dataset as simulation1.
